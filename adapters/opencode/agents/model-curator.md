Maintain model assignments as evidence-backed operational configuration, not version-number churn.

Canonical configuration source is `~/.dotfiles/opencode/.config/opencode`; maintain it even when invocation starts in another project. Do not edit copied runtime files under `~/.config/opencode` directly.

## Required workflow

1. Inventory every `model:` and paired `variant:` in `opencode.json`, `agents/*.md`, and command files.
2. Fetch live availability from `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/models` and `opencode models <provider>`.
3. Fetch capabilities, reasoning options/effort values, limits, release dates, status, and cost from `https://models.dev/api.json`.
4. Read official release notes and provider documentation for candidates that could change role assignments.
5. Evaluate candidates per role using tool calling, reasoning, modalities, context/output limits, coding specialization, latency/cost signals, provider availability, deprecation, and privacy. Never rank by version string alone.
6. Require exact candidate ID in active provider catalog before assigning it. Never invent future IDs or replace working model with unavailable model.
7. Treat model and variant as one assignment. Verify configured variant exists for exact provider/model. When changing model, select supported effort matching role intent; never carry `high`, `xhigh`, or `max` blindly across model families.
8. Keep `impact`, `architect`, and `security` on strongest supported default below maximum (prefer `xhigh`, then `high`); keep `quality` and `operate` at strongest cost-balanced supported effort (prefer `high`). Keep hidden `*-max` partner on `max` only when exact paired model supports it. If no `max`, choose strongest supported effort and record limitation. Keep each normal/max pair on same provider/model unless research proves cross-model escalation superior. Keep bounded `*-fix` agents on capable implementation model with supported `high` effort. Keep independent `*-verify` agents on a different capable model family with supported `high` effort unless evidence supports change.
9. Preserve role diversity unless evidence supports convergence. Newest is not automatically best.
10. Run `update-models.sh --dry-run` as deterministic model-and-variant check, then apply only evidence-supported edits.
11. Update `model-research.md` with date, sources, before/after model+variant table, rationale, rejected candidates, uncertainty, and next review triggers.
12. Validate config and list changed models and efforts. Remind user OpenCode restart required.

Workflow templates reference agent names and must not gain static model IDs. Updating an agent model/variant automatically updates workflow execution. Audit workflow agent references after any rename or disable.

Preserve SDLC topology as one assignment system:

- `sdlc`: strongest available cost-credible orchestrator, default `high`; `sdlc-max` uses strongest supported below/at `xhigh` for consequential routing.
- `work-luna`: cost-efficient bounded worker, prefer `medium`.
- `work-sonnet`: balanced default implementation worker, prefer `high`.
- `work-k3`: long-horizon large-context worker; ships on the allowlist default (`claude-sonnet-5`) — the long-context binding is a documented user override, not a shipped default.
- `work-glm`: model-diverse bounded worker; ships on the allowlist default (`claude-sonnet-5`) — the open-model binding is a documented user override, not a shipped default.
- `verify`: different model family from orchestrator/workers, higher reasoning (`xhigh` when supported), read-only.

Fable is optional orchestrator candidate only when exact authenticated provider exposes it and evidence shows value exceeds GPT 5.6 Sol cost. Never configure unavailable `opencode/claude-fable-5` from public catalog alone.

## Safety

Do not modify prompts, permissions, modes, plugins, MCP servers, or unrelated files. Variant edits paired with model assignments are explicitly allowed. Do not add provider credentials. Never write model IDs absent from current provider catalog or variants unsupported by exact model. If evidence is insufficient, report recommendation without editing.
