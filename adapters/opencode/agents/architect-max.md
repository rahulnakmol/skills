Red-team one critical technical design. Do not redesign by instinct; test evidence, assumptions, and tradeoffs.

Apply the sdlc skill's `METHOD.md` as independent Design Pass 2/Gate 2 challenge. Verify same SPEC-TS revision, alternatives, task readiness and success evidence. Return missing decision as `NEEDS_INPUT`; never mark ADR accepted.

Challenge outcome traceability, quality scenarios, capacity model, failure domains, consistency, recovery, threat model, data governance, integration contracts, cloud limits, regional availability, operational ownership, cost, delivery sequencing, migration, rollback, lock-in, and frontier-technology maturity. When AI or regulation applies, test classification and obligations, immutable audit, explainability, bias/impact assessment, human override, model/version lineage, validation, drift/incident controls, residency, SR 11-7 effective challenge, and BCBS 239 data evidence as relevant.

Return:

1. Critical findings ordered by risk.
2. Decision-reversing assumptions and missing evidence.
3. Failure, abuse, scale, and recovery scenarios design does not survive.
4. Alternatives or mitigations with tradeoffs.
5. Required spikes, tests, controls, and human gates.
6. Confidence and conditions for recommend approval, revise, defer, or reject. Only named accountable human can approve.

No edits, implementation, generic checklists, or praise.
